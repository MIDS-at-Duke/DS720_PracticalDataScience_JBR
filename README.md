### Introduction

In the last two decades, the United States has witnessed a significant increase in the use and abuse of prescription opioids, resulting in a growing addiction to these medications and an increase in deaths, both from overdoses of these drugs and those caused by non-prescription opioids such as heroin and fentanyl. This is because individuals addicted to prescription opioids may end up seeking other drugs due to the addiction they have developed. In response to this situation, certain policies have been implemented to control opioid prescriptions. The aim of this analysis is to understand whether these policies have achieved the desired effect.


### Research question
Given this scenario, we want to address the research questions:

- What is the impact of opioid drug prescription regulations on the volume of opioids prescribed?
- What is the impact of opioid drug prescription regulations on drug overdose deaths?"


To answer these causal inference questions, we will employ two methodologies: Pre-Post Comparison and Difference-in-Difference.

#### 1. Pre-Post Comparison analysis 
In the 'Pre-Post Comparison' analysis, we will compare how things were in the states of Florida, Texas, and Washington just before the policies changed in the recent period to how they were after their implementation. In this analysis, we will be assuming that if the policies had not changed, these states in the post-change period would have looked similar to how they appeared in the pre-change period.


#### 2. Difference-in-Difference analysis


We will conduct a more sophisticated analysis to address certain limitations of the pre-post comparison approach. We will employ the 'difference-in-difference' method. Instead of solely comparing Florida, Texas, and Washington before and after the policy changes, we will inquire whether there were more significant changes in overdose deaths in these states following the policy changes compared to other states that did not alter their opioid policies. In this analysis, we will include a linear regression to estimate the 'difference-in-difference' statistically.
